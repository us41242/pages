# Bellagio Fountains Night Screensaver

## Overview

This project provides a simple, yet elegant web page designed to function as a **dark screensaver**. It is specifically intended for use on a portable **Android TV Box** within hotel environments, offering a subtle, dark background while clearly displaying the current date and time.

The visual component is a continuous, looped video of the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, captured at night.

> **Note:** This page is designed to be used with the Android application **Dashboard Screen Saver**, which brings in this URL to display the page as a screensaver.
